### Hey there, I'm Harry Yu! 👋
So, you stumbled upon my GitHub lair, huh? Welcome! I'm just a regular ol' code enthusiast, navigating the wild seas of programming since my high school days.

### Chronicles 📜
Started off with Racket (yeah, that funky language where loops are like unicorns), graduated to C for some serious memory gymnastics, and then Python for a bit of everything. Nowadays, I'm cozying up to TypeScript and React for my web dev adventures.

### Greatest Hits 🎵
Remember tic-tac-toe in C? Yep, been there, done that. And the Python trading bot? Let's just say Wall Street didn't roll out the red carpet. But hey, I've also whipped up a nifty full-stack app for managing recipes and grocery lists.

### On the Hunt 🎯
I'm currently on the lookout for a front-end position, preferably with React and TypeScript in the mix. But hey, I'm flexible! If you're in need of a coding extraordinaire, let's chat!
